# Why?

When you have a list of things to remember, such as a grocery list or a job list, you don't know where to put them since you're forgetting or they're too long. As a result, we will take care of this issue for you.

  * The first section I saw was an app with a current date and time, as well as a to-do list.
  * When we click the add button, a box appears asking us to make a new note.
  * We can modify, delete, or complete this note after it has been added.
